## 📖 Overview

**C++ Library Collection** is a lightweight collection of reusable **header-only C++17 libraries** designed to simplify common programming tasks.

The project provides clean, reusable, and easy-to-integrate utilities for:

- String manipulation
- Date operations
- Date range handling
- Input validation
- General-purpose helper functions

The entire project is **self-contained**, requires **no external dependencies**, and is designed with clean code principles and reusable software design in mind.

## 📥 Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<yusuf-alshalabi>/Cpp-Library-Collection.git
```

Since the project is **header-only**, no installation or build step is required.

Simply include the headers you need in your project.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

```cpp
#include "Lib/String.h"
#include "Lib/Date.h"
#include "Lib/Period.h"
#include "Lib/InputValidate.h"
#include "Lib/Util.h"
```

That's it — no additional compilation, linking, or external libraries are required.

---

## 💻 Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "Lib/String.h"

int main()
{
    String text("   hello world   ");

    text.Trim();
    text.UpperFirstLetterOfEachWord();

    std::cout << text.Value << std::endl;
}
```

Additional examples can be found in the **Examples** directory.
